# to start repo tracking
git init

# to check status of the project
git status

# imagine you modify one file, many files in which you have source code
# if you run git status again, it will tell you that there are files
# that have changed 
git status  # output that some files have been modified
            # or even that there are  files not being tracked

# tell git to track the files you want to track, for example this one
git add filename
